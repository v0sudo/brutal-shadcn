# brutal-shadcn

Brutalist-styled UI components built on top of shadcn/ui — bold, loud, unapologetic design with the flexibility of shadcn’s modular, Tailwind-based architecture.

## Brutal UI meets shadcn precision

### 🚀 What This Is

brutal-shadcn is a set of TypeScript + Tailwind CSS components styled in a neo-brutalist aesthetic. These components extend the foundation of shadcn/ui (a modular, accessible UI toolkit) and add a toothy, industrial flair while keeping full control of your code. 
GitHub

Brutalism in UI is about raw expression and function — bold outlines, stark contrast, and UI components that don’t hide their structure.

### 📦 Included Components
- Button (all variants)
- Input
- Label
- Select
More to come, eventually. 

Ensure your project has shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and Radix (if used) set up correctly — brutal-shadcn reuses those foundations. 
GitHub

Import components where you want them:

`import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`
